This course is part of the two-semester sequence of the introductory
undergraduate physics labs. Students in Phy2049L should have taken or
be taking Phy2048 or Phy2054.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>NOTE: If you drop the lecture class during the semester you are taking 
the lab, you must drop the lab at the same time; There are no exceptions.</B>
<BR>

Physics is an experimental science and, while it is true that progress in
physics has always relied on the contributions of theorist, the
ultimate test of their theories takes place in the laboratory. The
experiments in this course cover most of the topics you will
encounter in your lecture course. They will be invaluable as an aid
to deeper, conceptual understanding of those topics. Fundamental laws
and relationships will be put to the test and (hopefully) verified.
The meaning of an equation will be clarified so that it is not merely
a collection of symbols. You will learn the use of several
instruments, and how computers can be interfaced with physics
experiments.

<UL>
	<LI>Students must sign in each class meeting to verify attendance. 
	<LI>Classes start the first week of each semester and end the week prior to the
	final exam week. 
	<LI>Make up labs must be completed during the days the same lab is conducted
	by attending one of the other sections. During regular semesters it
	is usually within the same week. During Summer Sessions, however,
	it's only within the window of either M-T or W-R. Permission from
	the instructor of the other section will only be granted if space is
	available.
